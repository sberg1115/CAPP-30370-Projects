    My goal after graduation is to hopefully have a job lined up. I hope to be living in Chicago, Boston, or New York. I am not sure which industry I wish to work in <em>as of yet,</em> but I am hoping it has something to do with healthcare or consulting. As a Science-Business major, I am leaning more toward the <strong>business</strong> side of my major. A better description of what my major even is can be found <a href="http://science.nd.edu/undergraduate/majors/collegiate-sequence/">here.</a> I decided last year that medical school was not in my future and to focus more on business.

    Here is a passage from a favorite poem of mine, "Desiderata" by Max Ehrmann:
    <blockquote>You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</blockquote>
